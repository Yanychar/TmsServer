projects.newprojectview.studyandlocation.guide.study.content = \
<b>Study methods</b><br/>\
<p><b>Heuristic evaluation</b><br/>\
An expert evaluation, where experts will confirm that the product follows established usability principles.</p>\
<p><b>Cognitive walkthrough</b><br/>\
A review technique where expert evaluators construct task scenarios based on a specification or early prototype and then role play the part of a user working with the interface -- "walking through" the interface.</p>\
<p><b>One-to-one interview</b><br/>\
Formal, structured event with direct interaction with a single user, asking her to voice their opinions and experiences regarding a product. Interview enable a dialogue with the user about her experiences and preferences with a product.</p>\
<p><b>Focus group</b><br/>\
Formal, structured event with direct interaction with a group of users, asking them to voice their opinions and experiences regarding a product. Focus group studies gather user experience and preference feedback from more than one user at a time.</p>\
<p><b>Usability evaluation</b><br/>\
Traditional usability testing either in a laboratory - or in a real usage environment.</p> \
<p><b>Ethnographic study</b><br/>\
Observing users in the field.  The best way to see exactly how things are done in the real world. Helps to determine their usability requirements.</p>\
<p><b>Surveys</b><br/>\
Ad-hoc interactive interviews with users, where set of questions are asked and users' responses are recorded. </p>\
<p><b>Questionnaires</b><br/>\
Questions are done on paper or on-screen and  distributed to users for filling out. Thus, questionnaires requires more effort on the users to fill out and submit. </p> 

projects.newprojectview.studyandlocation.guide.users.content = \
<b>Number of users</b><br/>\
How many persons should a study have?<br/>\
<p><b>Heuristic evaluation</b><br/>\
1 - 2 experts.</p>\
<p><b>Cognitive walkthrough</b><br/>\
1 - 2 experts</p>\
<p><b>One-to-one interview</b><br/>\
10 users</p>\
<p><b>Focus group</b><br/>\
8 - 10 users in focus group. Usually, two or three focus groups for one topic.</p>\
<p><b>Usability evaluation</b><br/>\
6 - 10 users </p> \
<p><b>Ethnographic study</b><br/>\
Highly depending on study details & content. Often,  2 - 3 experts will follow 2 - 5 users each.</p>\
<p><b>Surveys</b><br/>\
Average number of answers: 80 - 100 </p>\
<p><b>Questionnaires</b><br/>\
in this method, needed number of users is challenging to estimate because it is hard to say how many users submit the sent questionnaire. It is easier to think about number of answers.<br/>\
Average number of answers = 100 - 200. Naturally number of answers can be higher.</p>
